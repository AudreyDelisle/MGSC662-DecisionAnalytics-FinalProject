# COVID-Vaccination-Optimization
This project focuses on creating a model to efficiently distribute COVID-19 vaccines across Montreal. It aims to optimize vaccine allocation by considering factors like supply limits, demand at various centers, transportation costs, and urgency based on COVID-19 case intensity. Objectives include resource efficiency, cost reduction, and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions. With the resurgence of COVID-19 in Quebec, this project holds significance in managing healthcare resources. It addresses an 'Unbalanced Inventory Problem,' aiming to distribute a slightly limited vaccine supply over five weeks while minimizing transportation costs and unmet demand penalties. The key challenges include balancing demand-supply, diverse pricing, logistics, and prioritizing areas with high case rates. The ultimate goal is to create a model applicable not just for the current pandemic but to be used as a blueprint for handling future health crises, aiding in strategic decision-making and resource allocation in public health logistics.
